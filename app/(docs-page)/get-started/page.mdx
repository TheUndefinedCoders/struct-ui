Beautifully designed components that you can copy and paste into your apps. Accessible. Customizable. Open Source.

struct-ui is a collection of reusable components, each with a bunch of examples in different styles that can be used in various positions.
**I wondered how users would enjoy the journey of scrolling through a website if they didn't feel there was something special about it.**

##### Installation

You must install `tailwindcss`. As most of our components use `framer-motion` install it too.

```bash
npm install framer-motion clsx tailwind-merge
```

Must Add it in the `utils.ts`:

```tsx utils.tsx
import { type ClassValue, clsx } from 'clsx';
import { twMerge } from 'tailwind-merge';

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}
```

use this hooks for mediaQueries:

```tsx use-media-query.tsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

export function useMediaQuery(query: string) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    function onChange(event: MediaQueryListEvent) {
      setValue(event.matches);
    }

    const result = matchMedia(query);
    result.addEventListener('change', onChange);
    setValue(result.matches);

    return () => result.removeEventListener('change', onChange);
  }, [query]);

  return value;
}
```

### Motivation

The main purpose of **Struct-UI** is to make life easier for frontend developers.

Over the past few years, while building websites, I realized how much I enjoy creating interfaces that are reactive, clean, and user-friendly. But I also faced a recurring problem: many components I built were reusable, yet I often found myself digging through old files to find the code. It was frustrating and time-consuming.  

That’s when the idea struck me — *why not bring all these animations and components together in one place?*  
A dedicated library where developers can easily access modern, reusable, and production-ready components without the hassle of reinventing the wheel every time.  

I also want to acknowledge and give credit to amazing projects like  
[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) and [aceternity/ui](https://ui.aceternity.com).  

They inspired me to believe that a free, open, and developer-friendly component library like **Struct-UI** could also empower others to build faster and design better.
